## Reflection

1. The two ERD diagrams are identical and have no differences. The only difference is that the django table includes more information regarding the table in the database. 

2. The effort between the two is vastly different. I would always prefer to use django as it creates the ERD diagrams for me, and it includes things I would ususaly forget.
