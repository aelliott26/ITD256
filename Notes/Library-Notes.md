# My notes on the virtual library.

- Librarian name - Annemarie Anderson

- Her job is in research, help, and instruction.

- 53,000 print books.

- Checkout time is 3 weeks and can be renewed for 3 weeks again.

- Most college academic colleges use the Library of Congress’s system.

- The system divides all knowledge into twenty-one basic classes, each identified by a single letter of the alphabet. 

> These alphabetical classes are further divided into more specific subclasses, identified by two-letter or occasionally three-letter combinations. For example, class N, Art, has subclasses NA, Architecture; NB, Sculpture, ND, Painting; as well as several other subclasses. Each subclass includes a loosely hierarchical arrangement of the topics pertinent to the subclass, going from the general to the more specific. Individual topics are often broken down by specific places, time periods, or bibliographic forms (such as periodicals, biographies, etc.). Each topic (often referred to as a caption) is assigned a single number or a span of numbers. Whole numbers used in LCC may range from one to four digits in length and may be further extended by the use of decimal numbers. Some subtopics appear in alphabetical, rather than hierarchical, lists and are represented by decimal numbers that combine a letter of the alphabet with a numeral, e.g. .B72 or .K535. Relationships among topics in LCC are shown not by the numbers that are assigned to them but by indenting subtopics under the larger topics that they are a part of, much like an outline. In this respect, it is different from more strictly hierarchical classification systems, such as the Dewey Decimal Classification, where hierarchical relationships among topics are shown by numbers that can be continuously subdivided. 

- There are two sides to the library’s system: the front, where students can search and find books, and the backend, where staff can edit book information. Staff can also view all student information regarding checked-out books, due dates, and other information. 

- When sorting books back, the staff divide the books by call numbers on a large bookshelf and then sort them onto carts to shelve. 

- Once a year, they do a shelf reading, where they look through every book on the shelves to ensure they are in the correct space. 

- Students can search by author, topic, genre, and other general information. 

- Subject headings Pick one main subject heading to categorize books, for example, with the teacher heading, it could also be under educator or schoolmaster so the subject heading will pick one word such as teacher.

- 700-800 books are on “reserve” and are typically textbooks for classes. These books are kept separate and can be used only in the library. They are popular. 

- They don’t just have books they have calculators, rocks, and physics kits.

- They decide what books to keep based on the curriculums of each campus. 

- They have a shared ebook collection. 

- Colleges in Virginia will sometimes buy resources together to save money. 

- You can get books loaned from other campuses or colleges. 

- Rocks are labeled for each class. 

- They check out around 500 books a month.

- They get just about the same amount back.

- The students can go from a couple of hours a week to 4-5 hours a week.

- When there are no books to shelve, they do shelve readings or other various tasks. 

- Their print collection will be getting smaller.

- More books are being bought online, and scholarly articles and newspapers are all online.

- 7/10 students prefer print books rather than ebooks. 

- Searching for books is a challenge, as many different keywords mean the same thing.
