## Sorting

### The Importance of Sorting
Sorting is essential in both computing and daily life. It helps manage information efficiently, making retrieval faster and reducing the cognitive load required to find what we need. Sorting allows us to quickly identify the largest or smallest elements, detect duplicates, count occurrences, and make data more human-readable. We rely on sorted lists daily, often without realizing it—our email inboxes, search results, and even bookshelves depend on sorting.

Sorting Theory
Sorting becomes more challenging regarding the number of elements in the list. The larger the dataset, the more time, space, and processing power required for sorting. Sorting efficiency can often be expressed using **Big-O notation**, which is an algorithm's worst-case performance.

* **O(1) (Constant Time):** The time taken by sorting does not depend on the size of the dataset.
- **O(n) Linear Time: Sorting time grows linearly with the number of elements.
- **O(n²) Quadratic Time: Sorting time increases exponentially and thus is not suitable for large data sets.
- **O(n log n) Linearithmic Time: Most efficient practical sorting algorithms
- **O(2ⁿ) and O(n!): Usually highly impractical
exponential and factorial
lots of computation required

### Sorting Methods
#### **Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is inelegant but straightforward. It repeatedly swaps out-of-order elements, making small adjustments until the entire dataset is sorted. Since it operates in quadratic time, it becomes impractical for large datasets.

#### **Insertion Sort**
Insertion Sort builds a sorted sequence of elements by inserting each element into its proper position within an ever-increasing subset. Slightly more efficient than Bubble Sort, it still sorts in quadratic time and has no practical application for large-scale sorting applications.

#### **Mergesort**
Mergesort is a very efficient sorting algorithm. The algorithm works in **O(n log n)** time. It works by breaking down the dataset into smaller, sorted sublists and then merges them. This method performs the sort much more efficiently than quadratic algorithms.

#### **Bucket Sort**
Bucket Sort works in **O(nm)** time, which operates under the principle of distributing elements into predefined categories, or "buckets," and then sorting each bucket individually. In cases where appropriate, this results in near-linear sorting times; this is useful when absolute ordering is not required.

### Sorting vs. Searching
Sorting is useful when data has to be accessed repeatedly, but if the searching is rare, there is no need to sort. Instead, it will be more efficient to simply scan an unsorted list. In this case, the trade-off between sorting and searching depends on the context and frequency of access.

### Library Sorting Examples
- **Danny Hillis' Roommate's Socks:** A poorly implemented sock-matching strategy highlights the inefficiency of unstructured sorting.
- **US Census Sorting (1890s):** The growth in size and complexity of the census drove the invention of sorting machines; these were among the earliest computers.
- **UC Berkeley Libraries:** Library assistants reshelve books by call number so that others can find them easily duhh.
- **Library Rough Sorting Areas:** Books that have been returned recently are left in a holding area until they are shelved again; such an area is a real world sorting cache.

## Caching

### Why Cache
Caching is storing frequently accessed data in a faster, temporary location to make its retrieval much quicker. It's an essential practice in computing where memory access is at varying speeds, but this concept is valid even for non-computer domains, like when organizing your desk to keep immediate items that are used frequently handy.

### Theory of Caching
Computers and storage systems use a sort of **hierarchy of memory**: the smaller, faster storage is used for immediate access and larger, slower storage holds data accessed less frequently.

### Cache Eviction Strategies
Due to the limited nature of cache storage, there is a need to get rid of the old data in order to provide space for the new information. Several cache eviction strategies exist including:
Least Recently Used (LRU): Removes the least recently accessed items first.
- **First-In, First-Out (FIFO):** Evicts the oldest stored items first.
- **Random Eviction:** Evicts data randomly when it needs to make room.


Sorting and caching are two key techniques that, enhance efficiency both in computing and daily life. We can optimize how we organize and retrieve information by balancing speed, storage, and usability.
